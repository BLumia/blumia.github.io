Apparently we are reaching the end of 2022, today is the Christmas day so it’s time to write my end-of-year review post. It’s a madness year with full of nonsense things going on, and even though I already used the term “madness” three years in a row.

I didn’t publish my last year’s end-of-year post due to some reason but I think this year it will be fine. For some unknown reason I’d like to write this post in English instead of Chinese. I’m bad at English so be aware there will be a bunch of typos and grammar issues.

# Wishes in my previous Time Capsule post

## Website

I have two wishes listed under a section called “Website”, and one of them is create and run a for-profit website. The reason is I’m still work in my previous company and I’m working on the type of the project that I’m very much not happy to work on: cryptocurrency. I feel like painful when I doing a work I hate so much, but I got mortgage to pay so I cannot just simply quit a job without finding out “what should I do next”. So, working on a “for-profit” site as a personal side-project is my safest doable solution so I could not rely on a job that I might “rage-quit” someday. It’s one of the so-called backup plans I have.

The short version of the storey in 2022 is, I quited the cryptocurrency job and join back to my previous company. More on that topic later, but anyway the source of the original concern is no longer valid. Even though I cannot cross that off from the bucket list, I’m actually happy with the result, at least for now.

My another wish is to update my personal website since most of the texts are outdated and I cannot even build the static site locally anymore. In 2022 I still didn’t find time to work on that, so I guess I need to move that to my 2023 version of the list then.

## Myself

### Go to a conference thing

I wrote this one for “give my self a reason to go outside my room and have fun” purpose, and I even noted “hope it won’t ruined by the COVID stuff” in my time capsule post, appearenly it was (once again) ruined by the COVID.

Actually I don’t think I should blame COVID, but for my own safety, it’s better not to wrote here who is the one I think to blame.

### Learn something completely not related to computer or technology

Usually I will write something about learning new stuff in my yearly Time Capsule post, like learning to draw, or getting start with a new technology. Since it’s something that unlikely I’m able to get it done, so in last year’s Time Capsule post, I just wrote if I can learn anything that not related to computer or technology.

I never wrote I plan to learn Japanese but this is what I actually did in 2022. I start using Duolingo in this year and my original goal is just simply learn about the recognize of katakanas(片仮名). When I finished the related courses, I simply continue learning the following courses just for fun.

The result is I actually learned something. I know it’s still in a very early stage of learning a new language, and Doulingo’s course can’t count as serious courses since they don’t really teach you grammar, it can still teach myself something basic and hopefully useful. I don’t know how far I can go by using Duolingo, but I do plan keep using it next year.

So yeah, I do have one wish completed XD

## Not really in my 2022 Time Capsule post

The above wishes are all the wishes listed in my previous time capsule post. My previous post didn’t end with a timestamp like I usually do, and I don’t really remember if I forget to finish the post, so I don’t know if there are something I originally plan to accomplish in 2022 but I didn’t list it to the post.

One thing I surely remember is I struggled about if I should write “Get a new job” to the list, and finally decide not to wrote such thing. It’s not hard to guess the reason since we already mentioned it in the “Website” section, and that’s definitely something I need to write.

# What I did in 2022

## Quitted my previous job

You might know the feeling about doing something you hate for a living. I actually feel mild about all blockchain-based technology before I actually start learning them, then I found out basically all cryptocurrency projects are some type of scam. Even if a project might not directly scamming people, it still might empower scamming people. The more I learn, the more I hate such thing. To be fair, blockchain-based technology can still be helpful as long as it doesn’t touch cryptocurrency. I have a separated post about this topic, so I won’t expand it here.

After the learning and working I done in 2021, I no longer happy about my job and feel painful while working. In the first few month of 2022 I feel like I cannot take it anymore[1], and I saw my “previous” company are trying to embrace the FOSS community again, so I guess it might be a good time to ask if they have a job offer available, and as the result, I decided to quit the cryptocurrency job went back to my “previous” company.

One fun fact is, at the day I decide to knowledge my company that I’m decided to quit, they also decide to talk to me about the job. Appearenly I also cannot work (that) effectively if I don’t like my job, so we talked a little bit, and I finally quited the cryptocurrency job.

I don’t think my previous workmate are bad. They did invited me to join the company (while at that time, the product that the company are working on is not related to cryptocurrency at all), and I also did earned a lot of money while doing the cryptocurrency job (because of course we did). I just feel like doing this isn’t the right thing. While I do hate the crypto thing, and looking back, I also somewhat regret join the company, they are still nice guys. They choosed to do the job simply for money, and also to be fair, they didn’t scam people, at least didn’t do it in a directly manner[2].

In 2022, we can see a lot of people choosing to do things I hate to make money. They use the lockdown policy to sell pricy products to people, they fake the COVID test report to get appropriation, then they start selling the pricy medicines and medical equipments after the lockdown policy get removed and most people start getting COVID…

I don’t hate rich people, but I hate doing bad things just for getting rich. I simply feel shame doing these thing. Instead of being rich, I’ll try my best stick to do the thing that is correct.

## Get my first bucket of money from Google…

…Play Store :p

As mentioned early, I need to come up with some backup plans to ensure I don’t immediately lost income when I quit or leave or lost or any other thing that might happen to my (crypto-related) job, so I did some attempts, and one of them is writing Android apps for money.

For some reason, I think writing Android apps can be much painful than writing desktop applications. AndroidX addressed some main issues that results the bad developing experience, but it’s still somewhat not good IMHO. Maybe I cannot get used to writing “enterprise style” code, so I did wrote some tiny apps, and I simply give up the idea about continue writing Android apps after I put my work on the Play Store.

All my work are open-sourced and I even put a free version that contains nearly identical functionality to the paid version, I didn’t do any marketing for my apps, too, so I didn’t really expect it could sell any copy out. In June, I found out my app sells some copy and I’m able to get my first batch of money from Play Store, which was actually surprising! Then I filled the related information, and also contacted the local bank to receive the money. After another week, I finally get my…one dollar[3] bill into the account.

Yeah when talking about the amount of money I got from that, it doesn’t worth to mention at all, but that actually made my day and I feel happy about it. Even if it’s just around one bucks.

<!-- It’s 1:10 AM 12/27[4], once again time to sleep so I’ll draft the next few headings to document what I want to write and then write the remaining part the next day. // It’s 23:28 PM 2022/12/31 now, let’s continue… -->

## …and from Bilibili

Since I can’t remember exactly when, I start recording my first-time playthrough of the video game I played. The initial reason is to give myself some resources about how the level/gameplay design works for the player since I was actually want to start making indie game for-profit (you already know the reason, sort of). Since making indie game for-profit in China is somewhat a unrealistic thing to do if I don’t have a former background of game making, so the only thing I did is doing the video record, and upload it to some website for later use. And apparently some site “encourage” people to upload video by giving them some money.

Since that type of video is basically a video dump, there will of course not a lot of viewer to watch. The site still encouraging people to upload video if they upload in a bi-weekly basis, and later I found out there are some bonus reward if people also do livestream, so I attempted to do that and see how much I can get.

For the record, I just simply record the livestream so the two things basically happened at the same time. Uploading the video still take some time though, since writing the description and add time marker will still take some time. Since adding time marker is somewhat a painful thing to do, I even take some time to add a chapter time exporting feature to the NLE software that I use [6]. Sadly the site that give me money still doesn’t support the chapter timestamp feature that YouTube has…

The result is …not that much, around 550 CNY in this year. I uses the money to do some (probably) stupid shit like commissioning people to draw a character that people barely know and have no chance to know its backstory [5]. Even though I barely need to edit the videos, doing the video recording and live streaming thing stilltakes me a lot of time, so I might stop doing that thing next year, or probably not that often.

Oh, I guess I can also put my GOTY here. I’ll give it to Tunic.
 
## Learned QML

After quitted my previous job, I once again got back my time and passion to work on the things I’m interested to work on, which includes trying “new” things that I didn’t have time to try. QML is one of them,

QML is a things that first appeared in 2009 so it’s not a new thing in this year, but it’s something I never touched. I did try to create a QML project via QtCreator’s new project wizard in 2016 but the pretty bad experience scared me off and then I never touched QML again. In the early days KDE start shifting to QML, the experience is also bad so it also makes me want to avoid this technology.

After a while, the QML version KDE’s experiences are no longer that bad, so I once again have the idea to give it another try, and the only issue is find some time. After quitted my previous job, I finally got chance to actually try it… and it sucks.

While writing regular QtWidget project, it’s painful to construct the UI element from code. One solution is using the designer and make use of its code generator (uic), but it will still cost a lot amount of time to write some trivial UI things. To be fair, QML beats the regular widget approach. Writing QML to do UI prototype could be much faster than QtWidget in this case, but developing with QML have some other painful issues.

In these days web-based applications are everywhere, and it’s somewhat very popular in developers so there are some less widely used new things that it’s still web-based like Tauri. For non-web-based application development, things like Flutter is also more popular than QML. And if you think about it, there are reasons for it.

I’m not a fan of web-based application, but web-based application development have a undoubtably good experience than most of other technology. Aside from the benefit of flat learning curve, existing browser application will always provide a powerful inspector so developer could always be able to know what possibly went wrong, and the IDE integration works at most of the times and comes with other handy features like hot-reload or live-preview.

QML, on the other hand, is way worse than most of existing UI frameworks. The QML designer won’t work in most of the cases, and once you start integrating with C++ code, tools like qmlscene (now also the “qml” executable) will stop working since it doesn’t know what’s the thing you’re referenced to. QtCreator, the first-party IDE, also have bad integration support of QML files which can complain about the code even if it’s valid, so it’s all on your own if the codebase start getting complicated. Also, beside the lack of powerful inspector [7], there are no (fist-party) live-preview or hot-reload support, so good luck debugging if something went wrong.

Another related thing is, the QML based framework (Qt Creator) also doesn’t come with a (real-world use case level of) usable default theme. They provided some themes based on other existing design language or HIG, but all of them are outdated, not suitable for desktop application development and incomplete. KDE addressed this issue by writing their own Qt Quick themes (they need to do it anyway) and other applications also have no choice to either choose to write their own Qt Quick theme (like what MuseScore 4 did) or just give up and use something else like flutter.

Oh I completely forget I’m writing my 2022 review shitpost instead of QML/QtQuick review, so let’s back on track. I start trying out QML by writing some small utility to test out existing bug, and then start learning more about QML by hacking into existing codebase and reading related documentations when needed. And after knowing about how to use QML to write stuff, I finally know things like… why people prefer flutter than QML :)

By the way, I also start using some other stuffs that I previously not a fan of, like mailing-list and the Matrix based IMs, but so far the experience of using these stuff is not that bad.

## The chaotic daily life of 2022

<!-- Well it’s 2023/1/1 1:31 AM now, I guess the only lefted topic is the madness of daily life in 2022, so let me write the remaining part the next day. //  now it’s 2023/1/2 14:18 PM. Let’s finish the last part. -->

I already mentioned a little bit about the madness of 2022 in the last part of the “quitting previous job” section, and if you live in China, you’ll know the feeling.

The policy applied here is blindly lock-down whole city without keeping social distancing in mind and also blindly remove all the restriction that makes social distancing work. Both of them lead to… well…

Most of people living in a flat don’t have any cooking utensils and they rely on ordering takeouts or eat in nearby restaurants. While the lock-down policy applies, they can no longer buy takeouts and restaurants are also not allowed to open, and the only thing they can by is the things that are required to cook before eat. Since lock-down policy applies, a lot of company corrupted and people lost their job but still needs to pay their rent and mortgage. They can’t get a new job immediately too also due to the lock down policy.

After the lock-down policy get completely removed, people are immediately start working together and throw social distancing out of the mind, which results COVID get spread fast than ever. Medicine supply doesn’t come as fast as the nuclein test reagents so cold medicines are out-of-stock very fast and people are not able to buy them when needed.

While that represents, it leaves a huge amount of space to ensure the chaotic madness to keep happening. You’ll need to wat a long line to do COVID test and you might need to do it multiple times in a day. You’ll have no choice to buy products from some sort of black market, and standing the superising pricy products at the same time. Or you’ll need to store a lot of food and medicines beforehand to prevert anything bad happening if you don’t want to do that. You’ll need to keep an eye on the groupchat or applications that allows you to buy epidemic prevention materials while working, and made the purchase in the first few seconds before it’s out of stock. You’ll need to download a bunch of random apps that don't even have an official website, grant a bunch of permissions and submit a bunch of personal information to fulfill the need of different provinces and/or cities’ epidemic prevention policy. And now, you’ll need to be mentally prepared that someone might stole your medicine delivery package and you can do nothing to prevent that from happening.

I actually start storing extra food that could make me living for two weeks since a year ago, while I didn’t foresee the lock-down policy could be such a madness but my preparation indeed make my life much easier than other people. I also didn’t got COVID yet [8] but I still think all the madness happend in 2022 is unreasonable.

To make my life easier, I also bought some cook utensils even though the flat I’m renting barely have place to put them. I start storing even more kind of food too. Since the lock-down policy get removed and most of people already healing up from COVID, I guess the madness will eventually disappear in 2023…

# At last…

I guess it’s the end of this post. Luckly this doesn’t become another ranting post like the previous one that I didn’t post.

I stop counting years after COVID19 and feel like the time is freezed to 2019 because all kinds of madness. Let’s just hope 2023 could be a better year.

[1]: Even have some argument with my family during the 2022 lunar new year holidays, and cried a little bit due to the feeling of grievance…
[2]: Don’t wanna talk about the details, but the job is related to fool the bots and get profit, or doing something similar.
[3]: Actually, more than one dollar, but definitely less than two dollars.
[4]: I sometimes switch to other window and do some other things, so the timestamps doesn’t means it take me that long to write these stuff. Wait, why do I even need to add this footnote at the first place?
[5]: What are you excepting when reading this footnote?
[6]: Kdenlive, and for some reason they even enhanced that feature I added previously, and featured it in their last update’s release post.
[7]: Gammaray by KDAB can be used, though.
[8]: While I’m still living at Wuhan, I had a serious cold just right before COVID19 happened and sometimes I think it might be COVID. I don’t feel anything wrong with my lungs, though.

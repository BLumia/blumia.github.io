BLumia (Gary Wang, for real), is a young programmer from China. With his hobby, he is still messing around, creating stuff in order to fill his empty soul. This site is also the result of what he is doing.

~~This site is built from scratch with PHP and using a (so called) home made scaffold engine named [Mutter](https://github.com/BLumia/Mutter).~~ This (half static) site is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. For previous version of his website, he tryed WordPress, Typecho, Hexo for his blogging system but none of them can fit his require, and, did you know he start making his own web pages since 2012?

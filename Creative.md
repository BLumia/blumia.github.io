Since I am interested in a lot of stuff like programming and music producing, I created lots of "Things" like my open source projects and my soundtracks / remixes (and maybe my artwork someday?). So here you can get a list of projects.

## Programming

Here is a list of projects I am / was working on. Most of them are open source project and host on my [GitHub](https://github.com/BLumia/). There are also some projects not maintained by me but I was taking part in development, just check it out if you are interested.

Most newer projects come with a license file, please refer to them for licensing details. If not, the project's source code are provided "as-is", licensed under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and come with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. So please use them at your own risk. 

### My Working Gears

 - [QtCreator](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/) My primary cross-platform RAD IDE.
 - [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) Free IDE offered by Microsoft, for some of my project on Windows.
 - [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/get-it/) and [Geany](https://www.geany.org/) Writing note, script, PHP or some quick programming.
 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) For my larger but not vary large project, and source browsing.
 - [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and [Craft](https://community.kde.org/Craft) When working on Windows C/C++ projects.
 - [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) ~~Edit config files~~ Help poor blumia in Uganda!

### Active Projects

// TODO 19-12-09: update this page.

<details>
<summary markdown="span">[Private Cloud Music](https://github.com/BLumia/Private-Cloud-Music) a really simple and easy to use online music player.</summary>

Private Cloud Music, short for PCM. It's a really simple and easy to use online music player, designed for quick private music hosting and sharing.

The project contains a single PHP script to provide the PCM API (Actually there is also a [Go version](https://github.com/BLumia/CloudMusicGo)) and all you need to do is upload it and your music files.

[Jxpxxzj](https://github.com/jxpxxzj) also did a react version of PCM front-end, [check it out here](https://github.com/BearKidsTeam/private-music-react).

I also wrote an [Android client](https://github.com/BLumia/PCM-Droid) for support offline listening and multi-server switching, but since I'm new to android, that android app is just.. emm.. doesn't works like what I want.

<details>
<summary markdown="span">[Pineapple Synth (Mini)](https://github.com/BLumia/PineappleSynth) a simple subtraction synthesizer (VSTi).</summary>

This is a simple subtraction synthesizer, delivered as VSTi plugin for DAWs like Cakewalk SONAR, FL Studio and etc.

Since it's just a simple synthesizer, and the project need a redesign [for some reason](https://github.com/BLumia/PineappleSynth/issues/2). Future development may comes with another new repo(omit the "mini" word from the project name). But I don't have enough time to working on this, maybe someday..
</details>
<details>
<summary markdown="span">[TouHou Player](https://github.com/BearKidsTeam/thplayer) a TouHou BGM player for all platform.</summary>

Co-op project with [Chris241097](https://github.com/chirs241097) .

This is a TouHou BGM player for all platform, with directly support for Linux, tested under my laptop (running Arch linux and Windows 10) and chris' laptop (running Gentoo).

Thanks to [thpacth/thtk](https://github.com/thpatch/thtk/), this player support all majer version (>=th07) of TouHou game. And it's possible to run under Mac but I can't test it since I never have a Mac computer.
</details>
<details>
<summary markdown="span">[Pineapple Pictures](https://github.com/BLumia/PineapplePictures) a simple Tencent QQ style image viewer.</summary>

This is a very casual project for my personal use, and it just works under both Windows and [Archlinux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pineapple-pictures-git/).

The reason of this project is just because the default image viewer under Windows cannot play gif animation and the UWP version of the new image viewer start so slow and it's too fat for me. Then when this project become usable, I found it also works fine under my Arch KDE desktop and feel it way more comfortable than using Gwenview.

Since this project is not for people other than me at all, I still list it here in case someone may like it.

<details>
<summary markdown="span">[Mutter](https://github.com/BLumia/Mutter) a lightweigth scaffold for blogging and creating web pages.</summary>

Mutter is a lightweight scaffold for blogging and creating web pages. It's free and open source, and it works on any hosts which provides a PHP enviroment like LAMP, WAMP, LNMP, etc.

<summary markdown="span">[Awesome](https://github.com/BearKidsTeam/Awesome) a simple and lightweight stuff-sharing web app. </summary>

Awesome is a simple and lightweight stuff-sharing web app write in django.

The original purpose is create a site for easily stuff sharing, but it's still complex than I've ever thought. Maybe you can treat this as a half-archived project.
</details>

### Learning Purpose Projects

Fan fact: It is an archived project, but I am still using it under Windows till now! Maybe I am the only user since ShadowPower doesn't even use his version..
